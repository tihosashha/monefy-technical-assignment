### List of bugs:  
1. If the account name is too long more than 50 characters, then it is not shortened in the side menu of filters 
2. In the search results, if the note had a long description of more than 50 characters, then it is also not abbreviated "..." in the search results
3. When changing the language of the application, if it is not reloaded, some of the elements are translated and some are not.
4. In the calendar, the month title is not placed in the center of the calendar, but is shifted to the left.
5. When entering the maximum number of characters in sum field and dividing it by two, the result is always 0, for example, if you enter 99999999/2 = 0. 
6. Drop down lists "First day of week", "First day of month" should have titles in the title.
7. You can choose the first day of the month on the 31st day, but there is not always a 31st day in the month. What will happen if there are 30 days in the month? There are no notifications for the user in this case. 
8. If there is too large a number in the pie chart, for example 9,867,281,515.91, then the currency is not separated from the amount there are no spaces rub9,867,281,515.91.
